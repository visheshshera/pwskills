    "Ans7) There are 2 types of loops in python:\n",
    "\ta)for loop-The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (example as a list, tuple, dictionary,set,or string) or other iterable objects. It is useful when you want to execute a block of code a specific number of times or iterate over items in a collection.\n",

    "\t\t    print (\"*\",end=\"\")\n",
    "\t\t#output=**********\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\tb)while loop-The while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is True. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on some condition.\n",
    "\tExample-\n",
    "\t\tcount = 0\n",
    "                while count < 10:\n",
    "    \t\t   print(\"*\",end=\"\")\n",
