    "Ans 1) String slicing is used to return any particular part of a string by providing its index.\n",
    "\tfor ex.- sampstring = \"my name is vishesh\"\n",
    "                 print(samplestring[4:6]) Output: am\n",
    "                 print(samplestring[:8])  Output: my name\n",
    "                 print(samplestring[6:])  Output: e is vishesh\n",

    "Ans 2) • Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "       • List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.\n",
    "       • List is mutable in nature.\n",
    "       • List items are indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3) Accessing items in list:\n",
    "            samplelist = [\"white\", \"red\", \"blue\",\"pink\"]\n",
    "            print(samplelist[1])\n",

    "Ans 4)  • list is mutable whereas tuples is immutable.\n",
    "\t• list is enclosed with [] whereas tuples are enclosed with ()\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\totherwise they both are ordered,allow duplicate values,indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 5)  • Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "\t• A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed.\n",
    "\t• Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.\n",
    "\t• Duplicate items are not allowed in sets.\n",
    "\tExample-\n",
    "\t\tsampleset_id = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4}\n",
    "                print(sampleset_id)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} #set being unique\n",
    "\t\t        print(sampleset_id)  # Output: {4, 1, 3, 2} #set being unindexed\n",
    "\t\t        sampleset_id.add(\"5\")\n",
    "\t\t        print(thisset) # Output: {4, 5, 1, 3, 2} #adding item in set and set being unindexed\n",
    "Ans 6)  Tuples:\n",
    "\t\tSince data stored in tuples cannot be changed,so they are ideal for storing immutable data. \n",
    "\t\tfor example: coordinates of a geographical location.\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\tSets:\t\n",
    "\t\tWhile sets are perfect for storing unique elements and when you don't want duplicate elements.\n",
    "\t\tfor example: finding unique visitors on a website.\n",

    "Ans 7) Adding items in dictionary:\n",
    "\t\tsampledict = {\n",

    "Ans 8) Benefits of Dictionary keys being immutable:\n",
    "\t• Dictionary keys are hashed to store and retrieve values efficiently. Immutable keys ensure consistent hashing, allowing for fast lookups.\n",
    "\t• Immutable keys guarantee uniqueness, preventing unexpected behavior due to key modifications\n",
    "\t• example: person = {\n",
    "         \t\t   \"name\": \"John\",\n",
    "         \t\t   \"age\": 45,\n",
